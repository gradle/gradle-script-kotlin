Gradle Kotlin DSL 0.13.1 Release Notes
============================

Gradle Kotlin DSL v0.13.1 brings support for `settings.gradle.kts` files, Kotlin standard library extensions to the Java 7 and Java 8 APIs for use in build scripts, improvements to the `plugins {}` DSL, and more!

v0.13.1 is included in Gradle 4.4 RC1.

The features in this release are also available for immediate use within the latest Gradle Kotlin DSL distribution snapshot. To use it, upgrade your Gradle wrapper in the following fashion:

    $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
    $ gradle wrapper --gradle-distribution-url
    https://repo.gradle.org/gradle/kotlin-dsl-snapshots-local/gradle-kotlin-dsl-4.4-20171117171149+0000-all.zip

Once Gradle 4.4 RC1 is out, we encourage all users to upgrade in the following fashion:

    $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
    $ gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.4-rc-1 --distribution-type all


Updates since v0.12.3
----------------------

 * **Support settings file written in Kotlin** (#56). Gradle will now look for a file named `settings.gradle.kts` whenever `settings.gradle` cannot be found during the [initialization phase](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#sec:build_phases). `settings.gradle.kts` is evaluated against the [Gradle Settings object](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html) so all of its members can be referenced without qualification. In addition, all members of the [ScriptApi interface](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/blob/37c28af671d0498c72c9e72d24227cddc7d3932e/provider/src/main/kotlin/org/gradle/kotlin/dsl/provider/ScriptApi.kt#L50) are supported and can also be referenced without qualification. Support for authoring `settings.gradle.kts` landed on IntelliJ IDEA starting with version `1.1.60-eap-43` of the Kotlin plugin (#531):

   ![settings.gradle.kts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51689/32514644-d11ab388-c3e4-11e7-91b0-d0f9bd8a6fde.gif)

    All [samples](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/95d1fcb02655f5abb1e47fa23f5c76b948dc4dba/samples) have been updated to take advantage of `settings.gradle.kts` support (#550) and new samples have been added demonstrating how to use `settings.gradle.kts` to configure:
    * the [build cache](https://guides.gradle.org/using-build-cache/) (#570, [sample](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/95d1fcb02655f5abb1e47fa23f5c76b948dc4dba/samples/build-cache))
    * dependency substitutions in [composite builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) (#571, [sample](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/95d1fcb02655f5abb1e47fa23f5c76b948dc4dba/samples/composite-builds))
    * [source dependencies](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues/42) (#572, [sample](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/95d1fcb02655f5abb1e47fa23f5c76b948dc4dba/samples/source-control))

 * **Default `build-scan` plugin version is the same as the one applied by Gradle when the `--scan` option is specified** (#490). Prior to this release, the default version of the `build-scan` plugin was hard-coded in the `kotlin-dsl` distribution. That information is now managed by Gradle Core.

 * **Expose Kotlin standard library extensions for Java 7 and Java 8 to build scripts** (#558). The build script classpath now includes `kotlin-stdlib-jre8` and `kotlin-stdlib-jre7` enabling the use of features such as [named regex groups](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/3194), [kotlin.streams](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.streams/index.html) among other things.

 * **Android sample update** (#586). Now on Android Gradle Plugin 3.0.0 thanks to @liutikas. Thank you, @liutikas!

 * **kotlin2js plugin sample updated to leverage the `plugins` block** (#539).

 * **Account for `PropertyState` deprecation in favor of `Property`** (#540). [`org.gradle.api.provider.PropertyState`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/index.html?org/gradle/api/provider/PropertyState.html) has been deprecated in favour of [`org.gradle.api.provider.Property`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/index.html?org/gradle/api/provider/PropertyState.html). Samples and API extensions have been updated to take the change into account.
