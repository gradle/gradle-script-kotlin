Getting Started
===============

The fastest way to get up and running with a Kotlin-based Gradle build is to work with one of the [samples](../../samples). You'll find complete instructions in the README there.

Please check out these additional notes if you want to know more about:

  * [Using Groovy closures in Kotlin](./Closures.md)
  * [Configuring plugins in Kotlin](./Configuring-Plugins.md)
  * [Kotlin versions and the Gradle Kotlin DSL ](./Kotlin-Versions.md)
